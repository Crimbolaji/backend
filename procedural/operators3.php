//In computer programming, it is generally used in conditional expressions to determine
//which block of code executes, thus controlling the program flow.

//1. Equal to "==" check the equality of 2 variable.
//2. Identical to "===" check value and data types.
//3. Not equal to "!="
//4. Less than < and greater than >
